# Waveform
 Read waveform and do stuff

Python 3.7

Required:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplot
- CV2 (for generating video from matplot graphs)

What it does:
- Read a song and output frequency spectrum of each 16th subdivision.
- Onset is still WIP, experimenting with FFT and what's the best way to get transients by frequency band, or just get transient and then evaluate frequency, idk

To do:

- Onset detection
- BPM detection
- Comparing pitch
- Time Grid / Clock / BPM
- Add the audio file to the video
